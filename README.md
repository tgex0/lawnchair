Lawnchair is a free, open-source home app for Android. Taking Launcher3 — Android’s default home app — as a starting point, it ports Pixel Launcher features and introduces rich options for customization.

This branch houses the codebase of Lawnchair 14, which is currently in beta and is based on Launcher3 from Android 14. For Lawnchair 9 to 13, see the branches with the `9-` to `13-` prefixes, respectively.

-   Pixel Launcher-like UI with Material You design
